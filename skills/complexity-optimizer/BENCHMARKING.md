# Benchmarking

How to measure speed and memory so the numbers can be trusted. Benchmarks are evidence of speed, not of correctness, and they never replace the differential tests in `DIFFERENTIAL-TESTING.md`.

## Benchmarks

- **Predict first.** Before running anything, write down the expected speedup at realistic `n` and the expected growth exponent of each version (the report's "Prediction" field). Compare the measurement with it afterward. A prediction that misses badly means the analysis is wrong somewhere: find out where before keeping the change.
- Use the project's existing benchmark tooling when present (see the language files). Otherwise write a simple timing harness in test code: warm up, run many iterations, report the median, and keep the result in a variable the compiler cannot discard.
- Measure the reference and the candidate at realistic `n` and at a larger `n` (for example, 10× realistic) to show the growth difference.
- **Doubling experiments.** To check a complexity claim, time both versions at N, 2N, 4N, and 8N after warm-up, and compute the exponent b ≈ log₂(T(2N) / T(N)): near 1 is linear, slightly above 1 fits n log n, near 2 is quadratic. Predict the next size's time before measuring it. Start N large enough that fixed overhead does not dominate, and expect the constant to shift where the working set crosses a cache or memory boundary. Report the measured exponent next to the claimed complexity; a mismatch means the analysis missed a cost.
- Use the same inputs for both versions.
- Include worst-case and adversarial inputs where relevant: already-sorted or reverse-sorted data for sorting and selection, colliding hash keys for hash-based structures, deep or degenerate shapes for trees and recursion. When untrusted parties control the input, search for the worst inputs as in "Finding worst-case inputs" in `techniques/hostile-inputs.md`.
- Warm up where the runtime has a JIT or caches. Run multiple times and report the median and the variance (or min and max), not a single run.
- **Alternate the versions.** Run reference and candidate in alternating or randomized order (A, B, B, A, …), not all of one and then all of the other, so drift in temperature, CPU frequency, background load, or caches affects both equally.
- **Control noise.** On the benchmark machine, avoid other heavy load, and note CPU frequency scaling and turbo settings; pin to cores where the platform allows. In cloud or shared environments, expect more noise and take more samples.
- **Separate the effect from the noise.** Report a confidence interval for the difference (for example, a bootstrap interval over the per-run times), or at least show that the gap between medians exceeds the run-to-run spread. A difference inside the noise is "no measurable difference," not a speedup. Use the benchmark tool's own statistics when it has them (JMH, BenchmarkDotNet, Criterion, Google Benchmark).
- **Use representative inputs.** Uniform random data can hide or exaggerate gains: real inputs are often partly sorted, skewed, or full of duplicates. Benchmark on production-like data (or a recorded sample) as well as generated data, and on the adversarial inputs listed above.
- Report absolute times together with percentage change. Percentages alone can make a tiny gain look large.
- Run the reference and the candidate in equivalent environments: same machine, same build type, same load.
- Record machine and runtime details with the numbers. JIT, garbage collection, and debug builds distort results; prefer release builds and repeated runs.
- Do not commit benchmark harnesses into production code. Keep them in test or benchmark sources if the developer wants them.
- **Offer a regression guard.** Propose keeping the benchmark (in the project's benchmark tooling, or as a separate job in continuous integration) with a threshold relative to a recorded baseline, so a later change that brings the cost back is caught. Never put timing assertions in unit tests: they are flaky. A test that checks a size-dependent count instead (comparisons, queries, allocations) is a stable alternative where the code exposes one. The developer decides whether to keep it.
- Label every number as measured. Big-O improvements and workload estimates are labeled estimated and never presented as measured results.

## Memory measurement

Rule 1 requires memory to stay bounded, so measure it, not just time:

- **Peak memory** during the benchmark for both versions.
- **Allocation volume** (bytes or objects allocated), using the platform's allocation profiler or benchmark tool where available.
- **Retained memory** after the call returns, to catch caches or indexes that grow without bound.

If the platform offers no way to measure memory, state that, and report the expected memory bound as estimated.
