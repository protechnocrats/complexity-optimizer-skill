# Rust

Load this file for Rust projects. Record the toolchain, the edition, and the minimum supported Rust version (`rust-version` in `Cargo.toml`): several standard-library APIs below were stabilized in specific versions. Check whether the crate is `no_std`, which removes `std::collections` (`alloc` still provides `Vec`, `VecDeque`, `BTreeMap`, `BinaryHeap`, but not `HashMap`).

## Built-in structures

| Structure | API | Key costs | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| Growable array | `Vec<T>` | index O(1), `push` amortized O(1), `insert(0, x)`/`remove(0)` O(n), `contains` O(n) | `with_capacity` avoids reallocations |
| Double-ended queue | `VecDeque<T>` | push/pop at both ends O(1) amortized | Use for queues and BFS |
| Hash map / set | `HashMap`, `HashSet` | O(1) expected | Default hasher (SipHash) resists hash flooding but is slower; **iteration order is randomized per process** |
| Ordered map / set | `BTreeMap`, `BTreeSet` | O(log n); `range`, `first_key_value`, `last_key_value` | Sorted iteration |
| Priority queue | `BinaryHeap<T>` | `push` O(1) expected, O(log n) worst; `pop` O(log n); `peek` O(1) | **Max-heap**; wrap in `std::cmp::Reverse` for a min-heap; no decrease-key |
| Linked list | `LinkedList<T>` | O(1) at ends | Rarely the right choice |
| String building | `String::push_str`, `write!`, `concat`, `join` | amortized O(1) per byte | |
| Slice algorithms | `sort` (stable), `sort_unstable`, `sort_by_key`, `binary_search`, `select_nth_unstable` (O(n) expected), `partition_point`, `chunks`, `windows`, `retain`, `dedup`, `swap_remove` (O(1)) | | See traps |
| Lazy iterators | `iter()`, `map`, `filter`, `take_while` | No intermediate allocation | Evaluate only when consumed |
| Lazy statics | `std::sync::LazyLock`, `OnceLock` | One-time initialization | `LazyLock` stable since 1.80; `OnceLock` since 1.70 |

**Not in the standard library:** bitsets, ordered-by-insertion maps, LRU caches, faster non-cryptographic hashers, small-vector optimizations, tries, segment trees, concurrent maps. Common crates (`fixedbitset`, `bitvec`, `indexmap`, `lru`, `rustc-hash`, `ahash`, `smallvec`, `arrayvec`, `dashmap`) are dependencies: ask first (rule 7). A small structure inside the project (a bitset over `Vec<u64>`, a ring buffer) is not a dependency but needs its own tests.

## Hidden costs

| Pattern | Cost | Fix |
|---|---|---|
| `vec.contains(&x)` inside a loop | O(n·m) | `HashSet` built once (check the ordering trap) |
| `vec.remove(0)` or `insert(0, x)` as a queue | O(n) per operation | `VecDeque` |
| `s.chars().nth(i)` inside a loop | O(i) per call, O(n²) total | Iterate once, or collect `chars()` once, or use byte indices when the semantics allow |
| `s.chars().count()` in a loop condition | O(n) each time | Compute once (note `s.len()` is bytes, not characters) |
| `.clone()` of large values inside loops | Allocation and copying | Borrow, use `&T`, `Rc`/`Arc`, or move |
| `collect::<Vec<_>>()` only to iterate again | Intermediate allocation | Chain the iterator directly |
| `format!`/`to_string()` in hot loops | Allocation per call | Write into a reused `String` with `write!` |
| `map.get(k)` followed by `map.insert(k, ...)` | Two lookups | `entry` API |
| `Regex::new` inside a loop or hot function | Recompiles each time (regex crate) | `LazyLock<Regex>` or `OnceLock` |
| `println!` in a hot loop | Locks stdout and flushes lines | Lock `stdout` once and wrap it in `BufWriter` |
| Reading files without buffering | One system call per small read | `BufReader` |
| `Vec` growing without a size hint when the size is known | Repeated reallocations | `with_capacity` or `reserve` |
| Indexing in hot loops with bounds checks | Bounds checks can block vectorization | Iterators, `chunks_exact`, or slicing once so the compiler can elide checks. Never `get_unchecked` without asking (see traps) |
| `Rc<RefCell<T>>` or `Arc<Mutex<T>>` graphs in hot paths | Reference counting, runtime borrow checks, lock contention | Index-based arenas or ownership restructuring |
| `Box<dyn Trait>` in hot loops | Dynamic dispatch, no inlining | Generics or enums, if the contract allows |

## Bit manipulation

| Operation | Rust |
|---|---|
| And, or, xor, not, shifts | `&`, `\|`, `^`, `!`, `<<`, `>>` (arithmetic for signed, logical for unsigned) |
| Popcount | `x.count_ones()` |
| Trailing / leading zeros | `x.trailing_zeros()`, `x.leading_zeros()` |
| Power of two | `x.is_power_of_two()`, `x.next_power_of_two()` |
| Rotation | `x.rotate_left(n)`, `x.rotate_right(n)` |
| Explicit overflow handling | `wrapping_*`, `checked_*`, `overflowing_*`, `saturating_*`; `checked_shl` for shifts |

Shifting by a count greater than or equal to the bit width panics in debug builds and masks the count in release builds. Use the explicit `wrapping_shl` or `checked_shl` when the count may be large.

## Rust-specific traps

- **Debug and release overflow behavior differ.** Integer overflow panics in debug builds and wraps in release builds (unless `overflow-checks` is enabled). A closed-form formula that overflows where the loop did not can panic in tests and silently wrap in production. Match the original's behavior with the explicit `wrapping_*`/`checked_*` operations it implied.
- **`HashMap`/`HashSet` iteration order is randomized per process.** Never iterate them where the original exposed a deterministic order.
- **Changing the hasher** (for example to `FxHashMap` or `ahash`) changes iteration order and removes hash-flooding resistance. For keys controlled by users or attackers, that is a security regression (see `BEHAVIOR-TRAPS.md`). It also needs a dependency.
- **Sort stability.** `sort` and `sort_by_key` are stable; `sort_unstable` is not. Switching changes the order of equal elements.
- **`dedup` removes only consecutive duplicates.** It is not equivalent to deduplicating with a set unless the input is sorted.
- **`binary_search` may return any matching index** among duplicates. Use `partition_point` when the original returned the first or last match.
- **`swap_remove` changes element order.**
- **Floats are not `Ord`.** `sort_by(|a, b| a.partial_cmp(b).unwrap())` panics on NaN, while `total_cmp` orders NaN and `-0.0` differently. Switching between them is a behavior change.
- **Drop order and RAII.** Restructuring code, caching values, or extending lifetimes changes when destructors run: when locks are released, files are flushed, or guards end. Lock guards held longer can cause deadlocks.
- **Laziness.** Iterator adapters run closures only when consumed, element by element. Converting between eager loops and lazy chains changes the order and number of side effects.
- **Panics versus errors.** A rewrite must panic, return `Err`, or return `None` in exactly the same cases as the original.
- **`unsafe` is never an optimization by default.** Do not introduce `unsafe` (for example `get_unchecked`, `set_len`, raw pointers, `transmute`) to gain speed without the developer's explicit approval, a written safety argument, and tests under Miri where possible.
- **Parallelism.** Moving to `rayon` (a dependency) or threads changes the order of side effects and floating-point reduction results.
- **Async.** Replacing sequential `.await`s with `join_all` or `select!` changes ordering, cancellation, and error behavior.

## Testing and benchmarking

- **Tests:** `cargo test`; doc tests count as tests.
- **Property-based testing and fuzzing, if already present:** `proptest`, `quickcheck`, `cargo fuzz`. Otherwise use a small seeded generator in test code; adding `rand` as a dev-dependency is still a dependency, so ask.
- **Undefined behavior checks:** run tests under Miri (`cargo +nightly miri test`) whenever `unsafe` code is involved.
- **Benchmarks:** use `criterion` or `divan` if already present (both are dependencies otherwise; ask). Without them, write a timing harness with `std::time::Instant` and `std::hint::black_box` (stable since 1.66) to stop the compiler from removing work. Always benchmark with `--release`.
- **Memory:** `dhat` (a dependency), heaptrack, or Valgrind Massif for peak heap and allocation counts.
- **Verification beyond tests** (see "Verification levels" in `DIFFERENTIAL-TESTING.md`; dependencies or installs, so ask unless present): Kani for bounded model checking with `#[kani::proof]` harnesses, including equivalence of the old and new function over bounded inputs; loom to run concurrent code under every thread interleaving up to a bound; Verus, Prusti, or Creusot for proofs of contracts.
- **Constant-time comparison** (for secrets; see `techniques/hostile-inputs.md`): the `subtle` crate's `ConstantTimeEq` (a dependency, so ask unless present), never `==` on secret slices.
