# Sequences, Dynamic Programming, and Search

Part of the advanced techniques. The shared rules in `ADVANCED-TECHNIQUES.md` apply to every table in this file; read them first. Tables are read as described there.

## Sequences and ranges

| Signal | Technique | Valid when | Typical result |
|---|---|---|---|
| Many offline range queries with no updates, where adding or removing one element updates the answer cheaply | Mo's algorithm | All queries known up front; add/remove are O(1) | O(n·q) → O((n + q)·√n) |
| Range queries and updates with a structure too complex for a segment tree | Square-root decomposition | — | O(n) per operation → O(√n) |
| Queries against past versions of an array | Persistent segment tree | — | Copying per version → O(log n) per update and query |
| Counting inversions | Merge sort with counting | — | O(n²) → O(n log n) |

## Dynamic programming optimizations

| Signal | Technique | Valid when | Typical result |
|---|---|---|---|
| DP transition takes the min/max over a sliding range of previous states | Monotonic deque | The range of candidate states slides monotonically | O(n·k) → O(n) amortized total |
| Transition minimizes a linear function of earlier states (dp[j] + a[i]·b[j]) | Convex hull trick or Li Chao tree | The transition has that exact linear form | O(n²) → O(n log n), or O(n) with monotonic slopes and queries |
| Optimal split point moves monotonically as i grows | Divide-and-conquer optimization | Monotonicity of the optimal split point is proven | O(k·n²) → O(k·n log n) |
| Interval DP where cost satisfies the quadrangle inequality | Knuth optimization | Quadrangle inequality and monotonicity hold | O(n³) → O(n²) |
| Optimal segmentation or partitioning | Interval DP, partition DP, prefix DP | — | Exhaustive partition enumeration → O(states × transitions per state), often O(n²) or O(n³) |
| Counts or properties of every number in a huge range, digit by digit | Digit DP | Property decomposes over digits | O(range) → O(digits · states) |
| Aggregating over all subsets of each mask | Sum over subsets (SOS) DP | — | O(3^n) → O(n·2^n) |

## Combinatorial search

| Signal | Technique | Valid when | Typical result |
|---|---|---|---|
| Subset search with n roughly 30 to 45 | Meet-in-the-middle with sorting or hashing | The problem splits into two halves whose results combine | O(2^n) → roughly O(2^(n/2) · n) |
| Search with a strong bound on the best possible remaining result | Branch and bound | The bound is valid (never prunes the optimum) | Large practical speedups; worst case exponential |
| Constraint satisfaction (scheduling, configuration, puzzles) | Constraint propagation with backtracking; most-constrained-variable ordering | Propagation rules are sound | Large practical speedups; worst case exponential |
| Repeated states in a search | Memoize states in a hash set | State has a canonical, hashable form | Repeated subtrees → explored once |
| Deep search where memory for BFS is too large | Iterative deepening (IDDFS, IDA*) | — | Same time order as BFS with O(depth) memory |

## Combinations

| Combination | Solves | Result |
|---|---|---|
| Meet-in-the-middle + hashing or sorting | Subset sum, balanced partition for medium n | O(2^n) → roughly O(2^(n/2) · n) |
