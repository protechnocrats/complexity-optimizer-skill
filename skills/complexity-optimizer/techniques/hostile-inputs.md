# Hostile Inputs, Secrets, and Hard Deadlines

Part of the advanced techniques. The shared rules in `ADVANCED-TECHNIQUES.md` apply to every table in this file; read them first. Tables are read as described there.

Load this file when the exposure check (Phase 2 in `WORKFLOW.md`, or write mode step 2) finds that untrusted parties control the input, that the code handles secrets, or that it runs under a hard deadline. Friendly benchmark data says nothing about these cases: the attacker, the secret, or the deadline picks the input that matters.

## Judge by the worst case

- **Untrusted input voids expected bounds.** An attacker chooses the input, so average-case and expected bounds hold only when the randomness behind them is secret from the attacker: a hash keyed with a per-process secret, pivots or priorities drawn from a generator seeded unpredictably. Report the worst-case bound next to the expected one, and benchmark the worst case (see "Finding worst-case inputs").
- **Keep every limit.** Input size, nesting depth, length fields, timeouts, and rate limits are part of the defense. Never remove or loosen one to gain speed; that is a security regression (`BEHAVIOR-TRAPS.md`).
- **Already covered elsewhere:** hash flooding (keyed-hash row in `techniques/data-structures.md`), regular-expression backtracking (`techniques/strings-and-text.md`), unbounded queues (`techniques/queues-and-latency.md`).

## Algorithmic complexity attacks

| Signal | Technique | Valid when | Typical result |
|---|---|---|---|
| Quicksort or quickselect with a deterministic pivot rule (first element, median of three) on attacker-supplied data | Introsort or pattern-defeating quicksort (fall back to heapsort past a depth limit); for selection, introselect or median-of-medians | Stability unchanged (all of these are unstable, like quicksort); tie order among equal elements may change, a behavior change if observable | Attacker-forced O(n²) → O(n log n) worst case; selection O(n) worst case with median-of-medians |
| Randomized structures or algorithms (treaps, skip lists, cuckoo hashing, random pivots, randomized load balancing) on keys an attacker chooses | Draw the random choices from a source the attacker cannot predict or observe (seeded per process from the operating system), or switch to a structure with worst-case guarantees (balanced tree, introsort) | The seed never leaks through outputs, logs, or iteration order | Expected bounds then hold against an adversary; worst-case structures need no secret |
| Recursive parsing or tree walking over nested input (JSON, XML, protocol buffers, syntax trees) | Explicit stack with a depth limit, or a depth counter that fails cleanly | Keep existing limits and their errors; adding a limit where none existed is a behavior change (rule 5) | Stack exhaustion → bounded memory and a clean error |
| Decompression, archive extraction, or expansion driven by input (XML entities, YAML aliases, templates) | Limits on output size, expansion ratio, entry count, and nesting, checked while streaming rather than after | Limits agreed with the developer; rejecting input is a behavior change | Memory and time bounded regardless of how small the input is |
| Buffers allocated from a length field in the input | Check the length against the remaining input and a maximum before allocating, or grow while reading | Valid inputs parse to the same result | Memory proportional to data actually received |
| Regular-expression patterns, not just inputs, supplied by users | A linear-time engine plus limits on pattern size and compiled program size | Match semantics checked as in the regular-expression row of `techniques/strings-and-text.md` | No pattern can force exponential matching |

## Secrets and timing side channels

Code that compares, derives, or looks up values using keys, tokens, passwords, message authentication codes, or private data is secret-dependent, whether or not it is marked as such. Its running time, branches, and memory addresses must not depend on the secret.

- **Optimizations that create side channels:** early exits and short-circuit evaluation on secret data; lookup tables indexed by secrets (cache timing, as in table-based AES); memoization or caching keyed by secrets (hit or miss timing); loop counts that depend on secrets; variable-time instructions such as division on some processors; compressing secret data together with attacker-controlled data (the CRIME and BREACH attacks).
- **Use the platform's constant-time primitive** for comparisons (the language files name it). Write one by hand only when none exists, and verify it.
- **Verify constant time:** a statistical timing test (dudect), tracking secret memory through Valgrind (ctgrind-style), or a formal checker; read the generated code, because compilers can turn branch-free source back into branches.
- **Every change to secret-dependent code needs review** under rule 5, even when outputs match: equal outputs do not show equal timing.

## Hard deadlines (worst-case execution time)

For interrupt handlers, kernel paths that cannot sleep, embedded control loops, audio callbacks, and latency-critical trading or network paths. A missed deadline is a failure, so the bound that counts is the worst case of every operation on the path, not the amortized or expected one.

| Signal | Technique | Valid when | Typical result |
|---|---|---|---|
| A hash table or dynamic array grows on the deadline path | Preallocate to the maximum size, use a fixed-capacity ring buffer, or rehash incrementally (`techniques/data-structures.md`) | The maximum is known and fits the memory budget (rule 1) | No O(n) growth spike inside the deadline |
| Allocation, garbage collection, or lazy initialization on the deadline path | Preallocated pools and arenas; initialization moved to startup; no allocation in the path | Objects are fully reset before reuse | Allocator and collector pauses removed from the path |
| Amortized or self-adjusting structures (splay trees, structures with periodic rebuilds) on the deadline path | Structures with worst-case bounds (balanced trees, deamortized versions that spread rebuilds across operations) | Same results; usually slower on average | No single slow operation |

Measure the maximum and the highest percentiles over long runs, never the median. Certified systems use static worst-case execution-time analysis tools (for example aiT or OTAWA).

## Finding worst-case inputs

- **Construct known worst cases:** sorted, reverse-sorted, and all-equal input; keys that collide under a known hash function; maximal nesting; the pathological strings for a regular expression; the adversary for a deterministic pivot rule.
- **Performance fuzzing:** fuzzers that search for inputs maximizing running time or resource use (PerfFuzz, SlowFuzz), or a coverage-guided fuzzer with a size and time objective. A fuzzer is a tool to install: ask first (rule 7).
- **Report** the worst input found, its measured cost, and the worst-case bound it is consistent with.
