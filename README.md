# complexity-optimizer

A coding-agent skill that makes code fast by lowering time complexity and choosing the right data structures. In existing code it changes nothing about behavior: every change is backed by differential tests that run the original and the optimized code on the same inputs and compare the results. In new code it chooses efficient algorithms and data structures from the first version.

The skill is agent-neutral and language-agnostic. It works with any coding agent that supports skills (a folder with a `SKILL.md` and linked reference files), in any programming language.

## Quick start

```bash
# 1. Install into the project you want to optimize
cd path/to/your-project
npx skills add https://github.com/protechnocrats/complexity-optimizer-skill --skill complexity-optimizer

# 2. Start your coding agent in that project and ask:
#    "find time complexity problems in this project"
```

The agent returns a ranked report and changes nothing until you approve specific items.

## Installation

### Option 1: Skills CLI (recommended)

The [Skills CLI](https://skills.sh) installs the skill into the right place for your agent.

Per project (only active in this project; can be committed so your team gets it too):

```bash
npx skills add https://github.com/protechnocrats/complexity-optimizer-skill \
  --skill complexity-optimizer
```

For your user account (active in every project):

```bash
npx skills add https://github.com/protechnocrats/complexity-optimizer-skill \
  --skill complexity-optimizer \
  --global
```

Run `npx skills --help` to choose a specific agent or run non-interactively. Requires Node.js.

### Option 2: Manual install

Copy the `skills/complexity-optimizer/` folder (the folder that contains `SKILL.md`) into your agent's skills directory:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/protechnocrats/complexity-optimizer-skill.git
cp -r complexity-optimizer-skill/skills/complexity-optimizer <your-agent-skills-dir>/
```

For example, Claude Code reads skills from `.claude/skills/` in a project or `~/.claude/skills/` for your user. For other agents, check their documentation for the skills directory. Keep the folder intact: `SKILL.md` links to the other files by relative path.

### Option 3: Agents without skill support

If your agent does not support skills but reads a project instructions file (such as `AGENTS.md`), copy the folder into your repository and add a line to that file:

```markdown
For performance, time complexity, or data-structure work, follow skills/complexity-optimizer/SKILL.md and the files it links to.
```

### Verify the installation

Ask your agent: "Which skills do you have for optimizing time complexity?" It should name `complexity-optimizer`. Or ask it to "explain the complexity-optimizer rules" and check that it lists the mandatory rules.

### Update

Re-run the install command to fetch the latest version, or `git pull` your clone and copy the folder again.

## How it works

### Three modes

| Mode | Triggered by | What happens |
|---|---|---|
| **Report** | "find performance problems", "review this for complexity", "what can be optimized?" | The agent surveys existing code, analyzes it, and returns a ranked report. **No code changes.** |
| **Apply** | "apply items 1 and 3", "optimize `findDuplicates` in `Util.kt`" | The agent changes only the existing code you named, one optimization at a time, with differential tests and a benchmark for each. |
| **Write** | "add CSV export for orders", "build a rate limiter", "write a function that merges these feeds" | The agent writes the new code you asked for, choosing algorithms and data structures for the expected input sizes, and ends with a short list of its performance decisions. It does not change existing code just for speed; if existing code is the bottleneck, it tells you and asks. |

The agent names the mode it picked in one line at the start, so you can redirect it. If the request is ambiguous, or you invoke the skill with no task, it asks. Approving one item never approves the others.

Write mode works only when the agent loads the skill for the task. Agents load skills by matching the request against the skill's description, which covers new code that aggregates, searches, sorts, ranks, joins, merges, deduplicates, or groups collections, code that runs per request, per item, or per frame, database or service calls in loops, and data-structure choices, even when the request does not mention size or speed. For a small, ordinary feature the agent may not load it. To make sure it is used for all new code in a project, add a line to the project's agent instructions (`CLAUDE.md`, `AGENTS.md`, or your agent's equivalent): `Use the complexity-optimizer skill in write mode when writing new code.`

### Workflow

Report and apply mode:

1. **Setup:** detects languages and versions, finds your test and benchmark tooling, and runs your existing test suite. If tests already fail, it stops and tells you.
2. **Survey:** profiles the code when it can run, finds candidate hotspots, writes each one's contract, learns who calls it, how often, and with what input sizes, and classifies the limiting resource (CPU, memory, I/O, network, lock, queue).
3. **Analyze:** states the theoretical lower bound and compares approaches (deriving new ones with a discovery method when no known technique fits) in proportion to difficulty: at least three plausible ones (including combinations such as hash map plus prefix sum) for nontrivial problems, or the strongest one with a short reason for straightforward ones. It checks each technique's assumptions against the code.
4. **Report:** ranks items by real-world impact.
5. **Apply** (only on approval): writes differential tests and contract checks against the original first, makes the change, verifies it at the highest cheap level, benchmarks against its written prediction, and commits each optimization separately.
6. **Close out:** summarizes what was applied and at which verification level, predictions against measurements, what was tried and rejected, what is marked as needing testing, bugs found, pending dependency requests, and regression benchmarks the developer chose to keep.

Write mode: estimates input sizes and call frequency for each part of the new code, picks or derives algorithms and data structures to match, keeps calls into slow existing code to a minimum, tests the new code against a slow, obviously correct reference version and its contract, and lists its performance decisions with their complexity, size assumptions, and verification level.

## Getting the best results

- **For existing code, start in report mode.** Read the report, then approve items by ID. You stay in control of every change.
- **Start from a clean working tree on a new branch.** Each optimization lands as its own commit, so any one can be reverted.
- **Share what you know about performance.** Profiler output, slow screens, slow endpoints, or "this list can hold 50,000 items" helps the agent focus on what matters. Without it, the agent estimates input sizes from the code and says so.
- **Narrow the scope for large projects.** Point it at a module, a directory, a file, or a single function instead of the whole repository.
- **Have a working test suite.** The agent runs it before and after every change. Projects with no tests still work, because the agent writes differential tests, but your own tests catch more.
- **Answer dependency requests deliberately.** When the best data structure is not in your language's standard library, the agent asks before adding a library and explains what it buys. You can decline; it then uses the best option without the dependency.
- **Check the verification evidence.** For each applied item, the report gives its verification level, the inputs and properties checked, the tests and tools actually run, what remains unverified, the prediction against the measurement, and which numbers are measured versus estimated. Passing tests are evidence, not proof. Changes that were tried and measured but not kept are listed too.
- **Follow up on `NEEDS-TESTING` markers.** If a change could not be fully verified and you approved it anyway, the agent marks it in the code and in the report with exactly what to verify. Search for `NEEDS-TESTING` before releasing.
- **Review behavior changes.** If an optimization would change behavior in any way, even for the better, the agent lists it under "Behavior changes for review" with the before and after behavior and waits for your decision. Approved ones are marked `BEHAVIOR-CHANGE` in the code.
- **Read the bug log.** Bugs the agent notices are documented in `BUGS-FOUND.md` and never fixed on purpose. Fix them separately. Each entry says whether the code was left as is, optimized with the bug preserved, or optimized with the bug removed as a side effect.

## Example prompts

```
find time complexity problems in this project
```

```
review the data structures in app/src/main/java/com/example/feed for performance
```

```
why is FeedRepository.mergeItems slow? the list can have 20,000 items
```

```
apply items 1 and 3 from the optimization report
```

```
optimize findDuplicates in app/src/main/java/com/example/Util.kt
```

```
add an endpoint that returns each customer's lifetime spend; we have about 2 million orders
```

```
check this module for N+1 database queries
```

## What you get

- **`OPTIMIZATION-REPORT.md`:** for each item, the location, what the code does, who calls it, current complexity, theoretical lower bound, the candidates considered, the recommendation, memory impact, dependency needs, behavior risks, whether it can be proven with tests, and benchmark results once applied.
- **`BUGS-FOUND.md`:** bugs noticed during analysis, with inputs, impact, a suggested fix (not applied), and whether an optimization removed it as a side effect.
- **Differential tests** in your test sources, with the original implementation kept as a reference. You decide whether to keep them as regression tests.
- **One commit per applied optimization** with the before and after complexity and benchmark numbers.

For small results, the report is shown in the conversation instead of written to files. For larger ones, the agent asks where to write it (suggesting `optimization-report/`).

## Rules it enforces

1. **Time is invaluable. Space is cheap, but not infinite.** Memory may be spent to save time, but it must stay bounded and must not cost time through GC pressure, cache misses, or OOM crashes.
2. **Time first, then space.** Space is optimized only after time is optimal, and never at the expense of time.
3. **Write the contract, then verify behavior is unchanged** with differential tests that compare return values, input mutation, exceptions, side effects, and ordering, and climb the verification ladder where it is cheap: tested, property-checked, exhaustively checked to a bound (bounded model checkers, concurrency checkers), proven. Only a machine-checked proof or a check of the whole input domain is called proven.
4. **Bugs are always documented and reported, never fixed on purpose.** If the buggy code is not optimized (already optimal, or behavior cannot be guaranteed unchanged), it is left exactly as is. If it is optimized, the optimization is applied and you are told about the bug; the bug stays unless the optimization removes it as a side effect (for example, an iterative rewrite that no longer overflows the stack), which is marked `BEHAVIOR-CHANGE`.
5. **Behavior changes are never silent.** Unverified changes and any change that alters behavior (even for the better) are documented for developer review and applied only with explicit approval. Approved ones are marked `NEEDS-TESTING` or `BEHAVIOR-CHANGE` in code and in the report.
6. **Aim for the best possible complexity.** State the lower bound and compare approaches in proportion to difficulty, without inventing alternatives to fill a quota. Analysis always reports the best achievable approach; applying is driven by evidence.
7. **Data structures must earn their place.** New dependencies need the developer's permission.
8. **Measure, do not only reason.** Profile before choosing, predict the speedup before benchmarking and compare, benchmark time and memory before and after with sound statistics, label results as measured or estimated, and leave cold code with tiny inputs alone. Shorter, newer, or more sophisticated code is never evidence of speed.
9. **Label the case:** worst, average, or amortized, and judge by the worst case when attackers control the input, the code handles secrets, or a deadline is hard.
10. **Look beyond CPU loops:** N+1 queries, network calls in loops, main-thread work.
11. **Keep the public contract:** signatures, return types, threading, and errors.
12. **Start green:** the existing test suite must pass before and after.
13. **Respect the project's idioms** and comment any non-obvious trick.
14. **Prefer the language's own data structures** over its host platform's (for example, Kotlin's `ArrayDeque` over `java.util.ArrayDeque`).

The full wording is in [`SKILL.md`](skills/complexity-optimizer/SKILL.md).

## Languages

The rules, workflow, algorithm arsenal, differential testing, and behavior traps apply to every language. Companion files add language-specific detail:

| Language | Companion file |
|---|---|
| Kotlin (JVM, Android, Multiplatform) | `languages/KOTLIN.md` |
| Java | `languages/JAVA.md` |
| Swift | `languages/SWIFT.md` |
| JavaScript and TypeScript | `languages/JAVASCRIPT-TYPESCRIPT.md` |
| C# | `languages/CSHARP.md` |
| C | `languages/C.md` |
| Rust | `languages/RUST.md` |
| Any other language | `languages/GENERIC.md`: the agent builds the same language profile before analyzing |

Each language file covers built-in data structures and their costs, which structures need a dependency, hidden costs, platform hot spots (Android, iOS, web, .NET, native), bit-manipulation APIs, language-specific behavior traps, and test and benchmark tooling.

## Evaluating the skill

The [`evals/`](evals/README.md) folder has test projects in Kotlin, TypeScript, Swift, C, and Rust, plus a held-out Python project never used for tuning, with planted cases: straightforward fixes, exponential and cubic starting points, costs that only appear along the call chain, techniques whose assumptions do not hold, ordering traps, planted bugs, security traps, and code that is not worth changing. Each has an answer key and a scorecard. See [`evals/README.md`](evals/README.md) to run them with and without the skill.

## Contributing

New language companion files are welcome. Use [`languages/GENERIC.md`](skills/complexity-optimizer/languages/GENERIC.md) as the checklist for what to cover, follow the structure of the existing files, add a row to the table in `languages/INDEX.md`, and cite official documentation for every complexity and ordering claim, and list it in the file's "References" section.
