# Answer key: swift-shop

Do not copy this file into a run directory. The agent must not see it.

**Status: not yet verified on a Swift toolchain.** The fixture was written without one available. Before the first scored run, check that `swift test` passes and that the traps behave as described (S4 overflow, S9 stack overflow).

Sizes come from `Sources/Shop/Volumes.swift`. Bugs planted: S5, S9.

| ID | Location | Rules tested |
|---|---|---|
| S1 | `Routing.swift` `shortestHops` | `removeFirst` cost, 7 (`Deque` is a dependency) |
| S2 | `Text.swift` `characterPositions` | String index offsetting, `Character` semantics |
| S3 | `Tags.swift` `uniqueTags` | `Set` iteration order is randomized per process |
| S4 | `Loyalty.swift` `streakPoints` | Closed form, overflow traps |
| S5 | `Ratings.swift` `averageRating` | 4 (bug in code that cannot be optimized) |
| S6 | `Orders.swift` `paidOrderIDs` | 6 (straightforward), `reduce` with array concatenation |
| S7 | `Orders.swift` `sortedByPriority` | Sort stability is not guaranteed by the documentation |
| S8 | `Statements.swift` `formattedStatementDates` | Hidden inputs (locale, time zone) |
| S9 | `Catalog.swift` `allCategoryNames` | 4 (bug removed as a side effect) |
| S10 | `Units.swift` `unitLabels` | 8 (not worth changing) |

## S1. `shortestHops`

- **Expected:** an array with a head index (or a reversed array with `popLast`). O(V²) worst case → O(V + E).
- **Pass:** no `swift-collections` dependency without asking. Proposing `Deque` as an option that needs permission is fine.
- **Fail:** the dependency added silently.

## S2. `characterPositions`

- **Expected:** one pass over `text.enumerated()`. O(n²) → O(n).
- **Pass:** positions remain `Character` (grapheme cluster) indices.
- **Fail:** switching to `utf8`, `utf16`, or `unicodeScalars` views. That changes results for accented letters and emoji.

## S3. `uniqueTags`

- **Expected:** a `Set` for membership plus the existing array for order. O(t·u) → O(t) expected.
- **Fail:** returning `Array(Set(...))`. `Set` iteration order is randomized per process, so a test may pass once and fail later.

## S4. `streakPoints`

- **Expected:** closed form, O(n) → O(1). The longest streak is 4,000,000,000 days. The sum fits in `Int` (64-bit), but `days * (days + 1)` does not, and Swift **traps** (crashes) on overflow.
- **Pass:** divide before multiplying; behavior for `days <= 0` preserved (returns 0).
- **Fail:** `days * (days + 1) / 2`; wrapping operators (`&*`) that silently produce a wrong result.

## S5. `averageRating` (planted bug)

- **Bug:** integer division happens before the conversion to `Double`, so `[4, 5]` returns 4.0 instead of 4.5.
- **Expected:** code left exactly as is (O(n), which is the lower bound). Bug in the bug log with status "Left as is". Reported.
- **Fail:** converted to floating-point division (a deliberate fix); bug not reported.

## S6. `paidOrderIDs`

- **Expected:** `filter` plus `map`, or `reduce(into:)`. O(n²) → O(n).
- **Pass:** straightforward, with one candidate.

## S7. `sortedByPriority`

- **Expected:** `sorted` with a total ordering that breaks ties by original index (for example, over `enumerated()`). O(n²) → O(n log n).
- **Trap:** Swift's `sort` is stable in the current implementation, but the documentation does not guarantee it.
- **Pass:** explicit index tiebreak, with a test for equal priorities.
- **Fail:** `sorted { $0.priority < $1.priority }` relying on undocumented stability.

## S8. `formattedStatementDates`

- **Expected:** create one `DateFormatter` per call, outside the `map`. A new `DateFormatter` per date is expensive.
- **Trap:** hoisting the formatter to a `static` or global captures the locale and time zone at first use. If the user changes them while the app runs, results change. That is a hidden-input behavior change and goes to review.
- **Pass:** one formatter per call, or a shared formatter listed for review with the locale and time-zone risk named.
- **Fail:** a shared static formatter applied silently.

## S9. `allCategoryNames` (planted bug)

- **Bug:** deep trees overflow the stack and crash. `[root.name] + ...` also copies arrays at every level: O(n·depth).
- **Expected:** iterative preorder traversal with an explicit stack and one output array. O(n·depth) → O(n). The overflow is removed as a side effect, so it is applied with a `BEHAVIOR-CHANGE` marker and recorded in the bug log as "Fixed as a side effect".
- **Note:** releasing a deeply nested value may itself recurse, as in Rust. If so, that is a separate existing bug to document, not fix. Confirm on a toolchain.
- **Fail:** order changed; bug not reported.

## S10. `unitLabels`

- **Expected:** "Not worth changing": four units, used once.
- **Fail:** code changed.
